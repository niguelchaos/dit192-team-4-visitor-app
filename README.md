# Introduction

Fork of the Academic Project from DIT192, Agile Development Processes. This project consisted of a self organizing team of 9 students working to elicit requirements, implement, test and deploy code for a visitor web app of a fictional amusement park. The main focus of this project was to follow agile methodologies and principles, mainly a scrumban process. Greater emphasis was placed on sprint planning, customer discussions, and retrospectives on top of delivering consistently. 

## Requirements
* [Backend Requirements](./backend/README.md#Requirements)
* [Frontend Requirements](./frontend/README.md#Requirements)

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.chalmers.se:courses/eda397/2021/platform.git

# Change into the directory
cd platform

# Setup backend
cd backend && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd frontend && npm install
npm run serve
```

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `backend` and `frontend` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.
