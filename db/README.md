# MongoDB and Docker
The local, development database in this folder is configured as a Docker container, taken from an official [`mongo:4.4.4-bionic`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) image of MongoDB.

### Installation
Instructions may differ depending on the operating systems, but given that the group uses Windows 10 and MacOS, the installation should be relatively straightforward. You will need to download the package for the recent most Docker for Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation process. During installation process or after initializing Docker for the first time, Windows users may be prompted to install [WSL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). If asked, the installer/application should provide the link to the required resources. Alternatively, you can follow [multiple](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10) [online](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-wsl2-windows-10) [guides](https://pureinfotech.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-2-windows-10/) on how to install and configure WSL2 before installing Docker.

### Commands
Docker Compose simplifies container management by separating the information dense parameters away from the commands. Parameters that would otherwise need to be manually provided in the regular Docker commands via input flags, are instead kept in the YAML configuration file. Given this dependency, Docker Compose requires to either execute the commands in the terminal while beinng inn the same folder as the configuration file, or use an [alternative syntax](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) (experimental and not recommended). With this in mind, the common ways of managing the containers are listed below, while further overview can be found in the [online documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/).

##### Run the container
> docker-compose up

This command runs the docker container with the containerâ€™s inner console (in our case, MongoDB's daemon terminal) attached to the terminal. The command uses `docker-compose.yml` to instantiate the database, users, ports, volumes, and other configurations if container have not been instantiated before. Otherwise, the container reuses configurations, logs annd data stored in the hidden folder `.docker`, under `./team-4-visitor-app/db/.docker/mongodb`. The storage folders contain .gitignore files that are configured to exclude all data from repository pushes, so everyone can instantiate and use their version of the local database without introducing merge issues in the repository.

##### Run the container in the background
> docker-compose up -d

or 

> docker-compose up --detach 

The addition of the `-d` or `--detach` flags allows to run the container in the background without attaching the container's inner console to the terminal.

##### Stop the container
> docker-compose down

This command shuts down the container that runs in the background. Alternativly, if you have the container running attached to your terminal, you can use `Control-C` to safely stop the container.

### Database credentials
The default credentials for MongoDB are initialized via the `mongodb.env` file. Currently, the database initializes the default databases, the development database, and two users.

- Project username: `team4usr`
- Project password: `team4pwd`
- Project database: `team4db`
- Root username: `root`
- Root password: `root`
- Root database: `admin`

### How to connect
- Hostname: `localhost`
- Database: `team4db`
- Username: `team4usr`
- Password: `team4pwd`
- Port: `27017`
- URI: `mongodb://localhost:27017/team4db`
